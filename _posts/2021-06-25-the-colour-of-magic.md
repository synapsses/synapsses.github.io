### About

The first of more than 40 books set on a mystical world where the eart is flat, and is being propelled forwards in space on top of 4 giant elephants who in turn are standing on top of a giant turtle. Interested much? Read on

Discworld books initially began as a series of jokes very loosely held together by a very thin skeleton of the story. It started as a way to satirize the cliche fantasy elements of the time. But in time grew to be more than just that. What began as a way to make fun of overly heroic our heroes are, evolved into books that examined and made the readers meditate on human condition itself.

I have read almost all of them and will share my journey with you as I read the rest of them.

### Review:

The Colour Of Magic is not only the first book in the series, but also one of the earliest ones by the author. And it shows. The perspectives change a lot, characters are more parodies than their beings themselves. The story is moulded fit the jokes. 

Getting that out of the way, it's important to note that there isn't a dearth of the most important thing. Heart. From the comically incomptetent Rincewind to the innocent at heart Twoflower there isn't a page where you wouldn't want these two to come out on top. Even the barbarian has his moments to shine.

The main story revolves around our hapless wizard Rincewind who's charged with showing around our clueless tourist Twoflower. It makes for a merry tale to see these two interact with the magical world and the equally magical people. Rincewind is charming ad cares about others even if he dooesn't want to! Top of the list being Twoflower! Demon photo box, a luggage with legs, gods, a barbarian and a troll make up for the rest of this hilarious tale. And it has heaps of dry British humour.

When I read this the first time, I remember remarking how much potential this series must have. And I wasn't proven wrong. 

It made me laugh and think, and believe in this world a little more. And that's all one can hope from books these days.

### Quotes

> “Every intelligent being, whether it breathes or not, coughs nervously at some time in its life.”

> “Twoflower was a tourist, the first ever seen on the discworld. Tourist, Rincewind had decided, meant 'idiot'.”

> “On the Disc the gods dealt severely with atheists.”

> “My name is immaterial,' she said. That's a pretty name,' said Rincewind.”

> “It was octarine, the colour of magic. It was alive and glowing and vibrant and it was the undisputed pigment of the imagination, because wherever it appeared it was a sign that mere matter was a servant of the powers of the magical mind. It was enchantment itself.
> But Rincewind always thought it looked a sort of greenish-purple.”

> “Sometimes I think a man could wander across the disc all his life and not see everything there is to see,' said Twoflower. 'And now it seems there are lots of other worlds as well. When I think I might die without seeing a hundredth of all there is to see it makes me feel,' he paused, then added, 'well, humble, I suppose. And very angry, of course.”
